TRIVIA GAME WITH TIMER

In this game, question, answers and images  are set up in an object.

- The user is greeted with a button to start the game with a welcome image showing at the top
- After pushing the start button, a question with 4 possible answers populates the screen with a timer
- Upon selecting an answer, or time running out, the answer populates with a corresponding image
- The answer is shown for a few seconds and then a new Question is provided
- Once all questions have been answered, the final score is shown
- a restart button is also included

## New things learned and used ##  

- using JQuery to dynamically generate screens and elements
- JavaScript Timing Events including (setTimeout & setInterval)
- using app.2.js is DRYer
